                This map aggregates data for Albuquerque, New Mexico and the surrounding area and serves as a communal resource for municipal, environmental, and demographic data. 
                The site is a place where people can make maps and visually explore different environmental justice issues, regardless of prior geographic information 
                science (GIS) knowledge. <i>abqMaps</i> was developed with the belief that that spatial questions are often better answered when paired with a visual component. 
                The functionality and data included on the site were carefully chosen after reviewing the environmental justice literature and other interactive environmental 
                justice web maps and can be used to explore questions related to data sovereignty, information accessibility, 
                self-representation, and civil participation.

                The site is a case-study on the current state of particular open-source web-mapping technologies (in this case, <a href='https://leafletjs.com/'>Leaflet</a>)
                and highlights the tradeoffs between web-mapping and creating maps using traditional GIS software. All of the code for <i>abqMaps</i> is freely-available to 
                view, download, modify, and share on <a href="#">GitHub</a>, providing a template for communities interested in creating their own interactive web maps to explore environmental justice issues.

                        As Mohai et al. (2009) review, environmental injustices can have economic, sociopolitical, and/or racial roots. 
                        Part of this has to do with what framework a researcher or politician is using in defining environmental justice, 
                        but another important piece is that environmental inequalities are often intersectional. Historical economic and 
                        sociopolitical initiatives like housing segregation can exacerbate current environmental injustices along racial 
                        lines (Grigsby et al., 1994), for example. I hope that by providing different boundary datasets, users will be able to 
                         get different views on how a particular issue affects specific communities.

                      Both environmental and demographic data should be included in an environmental justice map to see how different injustices 
                      fall along class and race lines. To highlight a finding from Mohai et al. (2009): many studies have examined the distribution 
                      of environmental hazards and linked them to health outcomes. However, these results were defined in either racial or socioeconomic 
                      terms. To date, the authors claim, the environmental justice literature (particularly the branches focused on environmental hazards 
                      and/or health outcomes) has not effectively brought these to lenses together to study environmental injustices. By including both race 
                      and class information from the census data, users will be able to view information along race and class lines, or along both race and class lines.

                      In Wolch et al. (2014), the authors found that many minority communities lack greenspace in their neighborhoods, whereas 
                      greenspace is concentrated in mostly White, more affluent neighborhoods. The authors note that this type of environmental 
                      gentrification is particularly damaging to minority and less well-off communities because of the physical and psychological 
                      benefits that greenspaces provide. Mullenbach & Baker (2020) find that as cities try to include more green space in 
                      disadvantaged areas, gentrification can occur. So whether because of historical reasons or current ties to land use conversion, 
                      lacking access to greenspaces is an environmental justice issue.

                      <p class="col-sm-12">
                      But lacking greenspaces has other serious effects, as well. Urban heat risk is strongly associated with temperature, vegetation 
                      abundance, and the density of the built environment. Ziter et al. (2019) find that this effect is especially pronounced in areas with 
                      &lt 40% tree canopy cover. The authors argue that by increasing tree canopy cover, urban centers can help protect residents against high 
                      day-time temperatures. In Mitchell & Chakraborty (2015), this heat risk inequity was demonstrated to burden primarily minority and 
                      socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. That is why Drescher (2019) argues that we should increase urban tree canopy cover like 
                      Ziter et al. (2019) recommends, but we should be conscious that there are areas (primarily in impoverished and minority communities) 
                      where tree cover is severely lacking.

                        Arguably, a growing awareness of environmental pollution led to a more mainstream formation of the environmental justice discipline. 
                        A 2007 report by Bullard et al showed that “...people of color make up the majority (56%) of those living within 3.0 km of where 
                        hazardous waste facilities are located, in spite of being only 30% of the national population. And where two or more facilities are clustered, 
                        people of color make up 69%.” In Mohai et al. (2009), they call this the “chicken and egg” debate: which came first, environmental pollution 
                        or poor/minority populations? Their review concludes that, since the 1970s, hazardous waste siting has been biased towards being placed in 
                        minority and low-income communities. Longitudinal studies, the authors conclude, show some conflicting results, but that more longitudinal 
                        studies need to be done to determine the root causes of environmental pollution within a given area of study. Longitudinal studies are 
                        definitely important and should not be ignored, but we also need to address current injustices as they stand today. For example, a study by 
                        Johnston & Cushing (2020) backs up the findings in Bullard et al. (2007) and notes that <i>both legacy and new</i> polluting industries are located 
                        in low-income communities and communities of color. While the waste and pollution information included in this web app may not offer proof of 
                        the root cause of environmental injustice, it can nevertheless point to <i>current</i> injustices, should they exist.

                        As Bullard (2003) notes, transportation is a civil rights issue. Transit allows access to jobs, government services, and recreation, 
                        though transportation access is not adequately distributed in urban spaces. Deka (2004) points out that a lack of transportation options 
                        in low-income neighborhoods forces people residing in those areas to pay more (as a percentage of their income) for transportation even 
                        though they are already economically disadvantaged. Forkenbrock & Schweitzer (1999) note that introducing transportation options/networks 
                        into disadvantaged communities actually has the opportunity to introduce unwanted noise and pollution. This concern should be taken seriously, 
                        given that environmental justice communities as those that are already economically or environmentally burdened by pollution. Further, 
                        transportation access has implications for health outcomes. Being able to bike and walk allows community members a healthy, emissions-free 
                        transportation option. A lack of transportation can also contribute to the creation of food deserts in urban areas. The fact that transportation 
                        access is distributed unequally and contributes to pollution, health outcomes, and disparate economic opportunities makes transportation a 
                        foundational environmental justice issue.

                        A review of food disparities by Hilmers et. al. (2012) found that food access is a major problem in many urban and rural settings in the United States. 
                        Their findings show that poorer neighborhoods and neighborhoods where minority populations reside had less access to healthy foods. We can call this 
                        phenomenon a “food desert”, whereby disadvantaged neighborhoods have less access to grocery stores and rely on gas stations, convenience stores, and 
                        fast-food chains for buying food. As the authors point out, transportation is a key barrier for accessing healthy food, adding to health disparities 
                        in areas that may already be affected by higher rates of pollution or a lack of other necessary social services.

                        Environmental justice communities in urban areas are often much hotter than more well-off neighborhoods. Additionally, low-income and minority communities 
                        spend a high percentage of their income on transportation. The same can be said of their energy bills, which is why Behles (2013) argues that installing 
                        renewable energy and energy efficiency upgrades should be a central strategy for addressing environmental justice inequities. Outka (2012) goes further 
                        by saying that environmental justice communities can benefit from the renewable energy transition by being able to participate in “green economic development”. 
                        However, polluting industries are often clustered in economically-disadvantaged and minority communities. The green energy transition produces deleterious social 
                        and environmental effects through extractive mining processes, chemically intensive processing techniques for metals or plastics needed for solar panels and wind 
                        turbines, and through the direct seizure of land to establish energy generation plants. Ottinger (2013) calls for a just transition to renewable energy that distributes 
                        the environmental harms of materials production while distributing the placement of energy generation centers so that no one community is responsible for housing large 
                        infrastructure projects.

                        By including connectivity data in this environmental justice map, I am hoping to spatially represent access to environmental information. 
                        As more and more information moves online, from education to government services to methods of communication that run on internet connections 
                        (think Zoom, WhatsApp, Skype, etc.), it is more important than ever to ensure that everyone has access they need to participate in environmental 
                        justice issues. As Kellogg & Mather (2003) show, the inclusivity of environmental policies are directly influenced by citizen participation and 
                        how well government agencies can disseminate important planning and policy information to low-income and minority residents.

                        Kojola & Pellow (2021) examine the role state violence plays in environmental justice studies. The authors claim that state violence has helped create and 
                        now maintains environmental injustices brought about by colonialism and enslavement. Importantly, they link the role that policing and mass incarceration 
                        have in limiting who gets to participate in environmental justice movements, either through citizen forums or through protesting. Wilson (2021) agrees, 
                        adding that environmental racism is a form of state violence. Along these lines, Thompson (2018) encourages us to rethink the definition of environmental 
                        justice to the much broader category of removing toxicity from our spaces. The author includes mass incarceration and over-policing in this definition and 
                        likens it to the burden that low-income and minority communities face from pollution. Further, Thompson argues that money spent on the carceral apparatus 
                        is funding that could be redirected towards environmental justice goals and providing social services. This matches my own definition of environmental justice: 
                        social and environmental justice are linked and are often one and the same.

              <b>total</b> distance, so adding more than two points to the map
              will show you their combined distance. Please note: once you
              being a calculation, the ruler icon will change from transparent
              to a colored background

              the map of all calculations by again clicking the ruler icon.
